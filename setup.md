# IA Gen

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.6.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

This project uses [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing. To run the tests, you have several options:

1. Run tests in headless mode (CI/CD friendly):
```bash
ng e2e
```

2. Open Cypress Test Runner (interactive mode):
```bash
npx cypress open
```

The test files are located in the `cypress/e2e` directory. You can add new test files with the `.cy.ts` extension in this directory.

Key features:
- Real-time test execution and debugging
- Time-travel debugging
- Automatic waiting for elements and assertions
- Network traffic control and stubbing
